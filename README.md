# Acunetix add-on for Dradis

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-acunetix.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/dradis/dradis-acunetix) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-acunetix.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dradis/dradis-acunetix.png)

The Acunetix add-on enables users to upload Acunexit XML files to create a structure of nodes/notes that contain the same information about the hosts/ports/services as the original file.

The add-on requires [Dradis CE](https://dradis.com/ce/) > 3.0, or [Dradis Pro](https://dradis.com/).
